The following subfolders are demontrations of several programming languages used to perform certain tasks. Where possible, equivalent programs will have similar names highlighting the syntactical differences between various languages. Otherwise, the remaining programs are for the purpose of demonstrating fundamental language features of the language the repository is based on. The overall purpose of this repository is to cover each language's core features for educational purposes, hence, any lesson references. All original files and materials are MPL licensed.
